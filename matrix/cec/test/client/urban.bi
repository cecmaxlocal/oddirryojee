'' Of course. The code you provided has several syntax errors that prevent it from compiling. 
'' It seems you're trying to mix variable declaration, assignment, and function descriptions all 
'' on the same lines.

'' Here is a corrected and working version of your FreeBASIC code that fulfills what I believe 
'' was your original intent. I have added comments to explain the changes.

'' Corrected FreeBASIC Code

'' This code:

'' Correctly declares a Function (not a Sub) to return a value.

'' Uses the correct data types (String for text).

'' Uses the correct syntax for assigning values (=).

'' Provides a full, working example including the function's implementation.

'' Prints the current directory path as requested.

' FreeBASIC - "Create COQuote" Example

' --- Function Declaration ---
' A FUNCTION must be used to return a value. A SUB does not return a value.
' "EVENT" is not a built-in type, so we will use a standard numeric type
' like Double for the hours, as it can handle fractions (e.g., 2.5 hours).
Declare Function COQuote(ByVal DHours As Double) As UInteger


' --- Main Program Body ---

' Declare variables with the correct types.
' Use String for text, not Byte. A Byte can only hold a number from 0-255.
' RKMA should be UInteger to match the function's return type.
Dim KGDU As String
Dim FLMA As String
Dim RKMA As UInteger

' Assign values to variables using the "=" operator.
' The original syntax "Var KGDU : "Fopes" ..." is not valid in FreeBASIC.
KGDU = "Fopes"
FLMA = "LINK"

Print "-----------------------------------------------------------------"

' Let's create an example value for the hours to pass to our function.
Dim designHours As Double = 5.5

' Now, call the function and store the result it returns in the RKMA variable.
RKMA = COQuote(designHours)

' Print the results in a clear format.
Print "Client Name (KGDU): "; KGDU
Print "Project Type (FLMA): "; FLMA
Print "Estimated Hours: "; designHours
Print "Generated Quote (RKMA): $"; RKMA ' Assuming the quote is in dollars

Print "-----------------------------------------------------------------"
Print "Current Path..."
' Use the built-in CurDir() function to get and print the actual current path.
Print CurDir()
Print "-----------------------------------------------------------------"

' End the program. A Sleep is added to keep the console window open.
Print
Print "Program finished. Press any key to exit."
Sleep
End


' --- Function Definition ---
' Here is the actual code for the function we declared earlier.
' It takes hours as input and calculates a simple quote.
Function COQuote(ByVal DHours As Double) As UInteger

    ' Define some constants for our calculation
    Const baseFee As UInteger = 150  ' A base fee for any project
    Const ratePerHour As UInteger = 80 ' The cost per hour

    Dim totalCost As Double

    ' Calculate the total cost
    totalCost = baseFee + (DHours * ratePerHour)

    ' A function returns a value using the "Return" keyword.
    ' We use CInt() to round the double to the nearest whole number
    ' before converting it to an Unsigned Integer (UInteger).
    Return CInt(totalCost)

End Function

'' Explanation of Changes

'' Declare Sub ... As UInteger -> Declare Function ... As UInteger:

'' In FreeBASIC, a Sub is a procedure that performs actions but does not return a value.

'' A Function is a procedure that does return a value. Since your declaration included As UInteger, 
'' you intended to return a value, which requires a Function.

ByRef DHours As EVENT -> ByVal DHours As Double:

'' EVENT is not a standard data type. I replaced it with Double, which is a common type for representing 
'' hours because it can have decimal points (e.g., 4.5 hours).

'' I also changed ByRef to ByVal. For simple types like numbers, ByVal (pass by value) is usually safer 
'' and more efficient, as it sends a copy of the value to the function.

Dim KGDU As Byte -> Dim KGDU As String:

'' A Byte is a small integer (0-255). It cannot hold text like "Fopes". The correct type for text is String. 
'' The same change was made for FLMA.

'' Var KGDU : "Fopes" ... line removed:

'' This line was not valid FreeBASIC syntax. Variable assignment is done with the equals sign (=) on separate lines:

'' Generated freebasic
KGDU = "Fopes"
FLMA = "LINK"
'' IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
'' content_copy
'' download
'' Use code with caution.
'' Freebasic
'' IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

''Added Function Implementation:

'' A Declare statement only tells the compiler that a function exists. You must also provide the actual code for the function,
''  which I did in the Function COQuote...End Function block.

Print CurDir():

'' To fulfill the Print "Current Path..." line, I added a call to the built-in CurDir() function, 
'' which returns the program's current working directory as a string.
