'' Of course. The code you provided has several syntax errors that prevent it from 
'' compiling or running. It seems you are trying to define a subroutine and then call 
'' it from a Select Case block.

'' I have corrected and restructured your code into a working FreeBASIC program 
'' that reflects what I believe you were trying to achieve.

'' Here are the main corrections I made:

'' Select Case Syntax: The correct syntax is Select Case variable, followed by Case value. 
'' Your original line was a mix of keywords.

'' Sub Definition: A Sub (subroutine) must be defined outside of the main program logic 
'' (like a Select Case block). You cannot define a Sub inside a Case.

'' Variable Assignment: The line Var HopeLivesLiving = New LivingLives is not valid. New is used 
'' for creating objects, not for simple data types like Byte. The correct way to assign a value is 
'' HopeLivesLiving = LivingLives.

'' Invalid Syntax: The => and UByte Or Byte syntax is not part of FreeBASIC. I have removed it.

'' Byte vs. UByte: In FreeBASIC, Byte is an unsigned 8-bit integer (range 0-255), making it the same 
'' as UByte. There is no need to choose between them; they are functionally identical.

'' Scope: A variable like Field declared in the main part of the code is not automatically visible inside 
'' the Sub. To change it, you must either pass it as a parameter or declare it as a Shared or global 
'' variable. A cleaner approach is to simply change its value in the main code after the Sub has 
'' finished.

'' Corrected and Working Code

'' This code sets a variable Field to 1. The Select Case block sees this and calls the HopeLivesToRevivalLiving subroutine, 
'' passing the myLives variable by reference (ByRef), which allows the subroutine to modify its original value.

'' Generated freebasic
' First, define the subroutine. It must be defined outside the main program block.
' It takes one Byte variable ByRef, meaning it can change the original variable.
