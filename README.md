Of course. Here is a comprehensive and professional `README.md` file for a project named `./jee` that combines FreeBASIC and Java.

This README assumes a common architecture for such a hybrid project: a high-performance core or legacy component written in FreeBASIC, which is wrapped and exposed via a modern web API by a Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) application. This provides a logical reason for these two very different languages to coexist.

A hybrid project demonstrating the integration of a high-performance FreeBASIC core with a modern Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) backend. This project serves as a blueprint for modernizing legacy systems by wrapping them in a service-oriented architecture.

## About The Project

The `jee` project addresses a common engineering challenge: how to leverage existing, battle-tested code written in a low-level language (like FreeBASIC) within a modern, scalable, and web-accessible environment.

The core logic, which might be a complex algorithm, a data processor, or a simulation engine, is written in **FreeBASIC** for its raw performance and native compilation.

The **Java EE** component acts as a robust wrapper. It uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) or Java Native Access (JNA) to communicate with the compiled FreeBASIC library. It then exposes the core functionality through a standard RESTful API, making it accessible to web clients, mobile apps, or other microservices.

**This project is ideal for:**
*   Modernizing legacy applications without a complete rewrite.
*   Exposing high-performance computational libraries as web services.
*   Learning about language interoperability between the JVM and native code.

## Architecture

The system follows a clear, layered architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns.

```
+--------------------------------+
|   Web Client / API Consumer    |
| (Browser, Mobile App, Service) |
+--------------------------------+
               |
               v (HTTP/S REST Calls)
+--------------------------------+
|    Java EE Application Server  |
|   (WildFly, Tomcat, Payara)    |
|--------------------------------|
|   jee.war (This Application)   |
|     - REST Endpoints           |
|     - JNI/JNA Bridge           |
+--------------------------------+
               |
               v (JNI/JNA Call)
+--------------------------------+
|   Compiled FreeBASIC Library   |
|      (core.so / core.dll)      |
+--------------------------------+
```

1.  A client sends an HTTP request to a REST endpoint defined in the Java EE application.
2.  The Java Servlet/JAX-RS class receives the request.
3.  The Java code calls a `native` method.
4.  JNI/JNA directs the call to the compiled FreeBASIC shared library (`.so` on Linux, `.dll` on Windows).
5.  The FreeBASIC function executes its logic and returns a result.
6.  The result is passed back up to the Java application, which formats it as a JSON response and sends it back to the client.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:
*   **FreeBASIC Compiler (fbc)**: [Download FreeBASIC](https://www.freebasic.net/get)
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher (e.g., OpenJDK).
*   **Apache Maven**: For building the Java project.
*   **A Java EE Application Server**: Such as [WildFly](https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/), [Payara](https://www.payara.fish/downloads/), or [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) (with JAX-RS implementation).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/jee.git
    cd jee
    ```

2.  **Compile the FreeBASIC Core Library:**
    Navigate to the FreeBASIC source directory and compile it as a shared library.
    ```sh
    cd fb-core
    ```
    *On Linux:*
    ```sh
    fbc -lib -w all src/core.bas -x libcore.so
    ```
    *On Windows:*
    ```sh
    fbc -lib -w all src/core.bas -x core.dll
    ```
    This will create `libcore.so` or `core.dll` in the `fb-core` directory.

3.  **Build the Java EE Wrapper:**
    Navigate to the Java project directory and use Maven to build the `.war` file.
    ```sh
    cd ../java-ee-wrapper
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This command will compile the Java code, run tests, and package the application into `target/jee.war`.

4.  **Deploy the Application:**
    a. Copy the compiled FreeBASIC library (`libcore.so` or `core.dll`) to a location in your system's library path. For WildFly, a good place is `<WILDFLY_HOME>/bin/`.
    b. Copy the generated `jee.war` file to your application server's deployment directory.
       *   For WildFly: `<WILDFLY_HOME>/standalone/deployments/`
    c. Start your application server. It should automatically detect and deploy the `jee.war` application.

## Usage

Once the server is running and the application is deployed, you can interact with the API. For example, to access the `process` endpoint:

```sh
# Send a POST request with some data
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "some data to process"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/jee/api/process

# Expected JSON Response:
# {
#   "status": "success",
#   "original_input": "some data to process",
#   "processed_by": "FreeBASIC v1.0",
#   "result": "Processed Result from FB: SOME DATA TO PROCESS"
# }
```

This request travels through the Java application, executes the logic in the FreeBASIC library, and returns the result.
